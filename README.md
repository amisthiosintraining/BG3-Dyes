# Baldur's Gate 3 | Dyes
I did dyes with ilikedetectives to see if we're still smart and not so colour blind.

## Where are my dyes?
I haven't tested where all the dyes are, but I made sure they're available in as many merchants as possible in act 1, 2 and 3. I'll update the list as I go along.

Act 1
- **Tutorial Chest** (in the nautiloid)
- **Volo** at the grove? I haven't tested it, see if pickpocketing works.
- **Arron**, Druid Grove
- **Dammon**, Druide Grove
- **Grat**, Goblin Camp
- **Blurg**, Underdark
- **Derryth Bonecloak**, Myconid Colony, Underdark
- **A'jak'nir Jeera**, Cr√®che Y'llek

Act 2
- **Quartermaster Talli** in Last Light Inn

Because I'm running short of time, here I have a list of the venders, but I took them straight out of Treasure Table from the dye files
